# whatsapp-chat-crud
This project is a WhatsApp-style Chat Application built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS, focusing on implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The application allows users to create chat messages, view all existing chats, edit previously sent messages, and delete chats, simulating the core behavior of a basic messaging platform.

The backend is developed using Express.js, following RESTful routing principles, while MongoDB with Mongoose is used for data storage and schema management. Each chat message stores sender details, receiver details, message content, and timestamps, ensuring structured and persistent data handling. The application also uses method-override to support HTTP verbs like PUT and DELETE through HTML forms.

The front-end is rendered using EJS templates, enabling dynamic content display and seamless interaction between the server and client. Static assets such as CSS are served efficiently to provide a clean and user-friendly interface. The project demonstrates strong fundamentals in backend development, database operations, MVC-style structuring, and server-side rendering.

Overall, this project serves as a practical learning implementation for understanding Express routing, MongoDB integration, RESTful APIs, and full-stack CRUD operations, making it a valuable addition to a developer’s portfolio and resume.
