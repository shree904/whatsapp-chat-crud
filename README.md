This screen allows users to compose and send a new chat message by entering the sender name, message content, and receiver name. It provides a clean, user-friendly form interface connected to the backend to store chat data in the database using RESTful POST requests. The feature demonstrates form handling, server-side rendering with EJS, and seamless integration between the frontend and backend.
